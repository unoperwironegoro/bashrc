# bashrc
Uno's small but growing .bashrc file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run
```$ ./bashrc_setup.sh```

This bashrc will then be sourced from your original bashrc.

## Contents

Contains mostly personal shorthands for git commands.

Also contains commands for manipulating the .bashrc:

- Edit with vim, and source on save:  
```$ bashrc```

- Add a file to source from, and then source:  
```$ addsource <file_path>```

- If for some reason you want to source the bashrc manually:  
```$ refresh```
