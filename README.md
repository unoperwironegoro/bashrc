# bashrc
My small but growing .bashrc file which I like to bring along wherever I code.


Edit the .bashrc with vim, and source on save:  
```$ bashrc```

Add a file to source from, and then source:  
```$ addsource <file_path>```

If for some reason you want to source the bashrc manually:  
```$ refresh```
